##About Me 

Hello, I'm Manav Bijlani, currently in my second year pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at The University of Adelaide.

I am a motivated individual with a passion for problem-solving and STEM technologies. I consider myself a lifelong learner, constantly seeking education from various sources and engaging with like-minded tech enthusiasts. In my free time, I enjoy reading non-fiction books and focusing on personal development.

My interest in algorithmic coding and data analysis has driven me to work on several projects throughout my first year at university. Currently, I am also engaged in an internship project at the Australian Institute of Machine Learning under the supervision of Dr. Ehsan Abbasnejad.

In the future, I aspire to become a software engineer, contributing to the development of innovative products while continuously enhancing my technical and soft skills. I am actively seeking internships and entry-level programming positions to further my career goals.
